"""1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming:
OOP allows developers to model real-world entities as objects in code, encapsulating data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. 
This approach promotes modularity, reusability, and organization in software development.
"""

"""2. Defining Classes and Creating Objects:
A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, defining the attributes and methods common to all objects of that type. An object is an instance of a class."""
