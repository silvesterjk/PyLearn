# Benefits of nested classes:
# 1. Namespacing: Nested classes can be used to group related classes together.
# 2. Encapsulation: Nested classes can be used to hide classes that are only used by the outer class. And allows private access to the inner class.
# 3. Readability: Nested classes can be used to improve the readability of the code.
