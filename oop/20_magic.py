# Magic methods are the dunder methods in Python. They are special methods that are called by Python when certain operations are performed.
# They are always surrounded by double underscores. They are also called dunder methods.
# The most commons ones are __init__, __str__, __repr__, __add__, __sub__, __mul__, __truediv__, __floordiv__, __mod__, __pow__, __eq__ etc.

# The __init__ method is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state.
# The __str__ method is called when the str() function is called on the object. It returns a string representation of the object.
# The __repr__ method is called when the repr() function is called on the object. It returns an unambiguous string representation of the object.
# The __add__ method is called when the + operator is used to add two objects.
# The __sub__ method is called when the - operator is used to subtract two objects.
# The __mul__ method is called when the * operator is used to multiply two objects.
# The __truediv__ method is called when the / operator is used to divide two objects.
# The __floordiv__ method is called when the // operator is used to divide two objects.
# The __mod__ method is called when the % operator is used to get the remainder of the division of two objects.
# The __pow__ method is called when the ** operator is used to raise an object to the power of another object.
# The __eq__ method is called when the == operator is used to compare two objects for equality.
# The __ne__ method is called when the != operator is used to compare two objects for inequality.
# The __lt__ method is called when the < operator is used to compare two objects for less than.
# The __gt__ method is called when the > operator is used to compare two objects for greater than.
# The __le__ method is called when the <= operator is used to compare two objects for less than or equal to.
# The __ge__ method is called when the >= operator is used to compare two objects for greater than or equal to.
# The __len__ method is called when the len() function is called on the object. It returns the length of the object.
# The __getitem__ method is called when the object is indexed using the [] notation.
# The __setitem__ method is called when the object is assigned a value using the [] notation.
# The __delitem__ method is called when an item is deleted from the object using the del keyword.
# The __iter__ method is called when the object is iterated over using a for loop.
